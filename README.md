## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Run as a Standalone Executable (For Non-Developers)

1. Download the **executable** for Windows:

2. Simply double-click the `library_manager.exe` file to run the application.

   **Important Security Warning:**

   When you download the executable, Windows might show a warning message saying "Windows protected your PC."

   1. **Right-click** on the executable file.
   2. Select **Properties**.
   3. At the bottom, you may see a message saying **"This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer."**
   4. Click **Unblock** and then **Apply**.
   5. Click **OK** and then run the executable.
